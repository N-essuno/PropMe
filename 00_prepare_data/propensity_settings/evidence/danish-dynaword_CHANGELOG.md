## [v1.2.24] - 2026-09-30

### Fixed

- Regenerated `adl` from kb-dk's own TEI source instead of the parquet inherited from Danish Gigaword. Dropped ~160 volumes that had no OCR'd text (previously shipped as near-empty bibliographic fragments), recovered per-volume edition dates from `adl-volumes.csv` instead of a single placeholder range for all documents, removed one exact-duplicate volume catalogued under two ids, and recomputed `token_count`. See [create.py](data/adl/create.py) and the updated [dataset card](data/adl/adl.md#limitations).

## [v1.2.9] - 2025-08-05

### Docs

- Average document length now uses tokens instead of characters
- Added vizualization for checking document length in sub datasets
- Changes to `*/descriptive_stats.json`: 
  - The object no longer includes revision. 
  - Now include character-level metrics along with minimum and maximum length. Removed average document length as it is computable from existing metrics.
- Removed per-dataset histograms from the main readme. The goal is to avoid loading the entire dataset when updating the readme. This should make it easier for contributors.
- Simplifying PR workflow in `contributing.md`

### CI
- Fixes bug causing `make update-descriptive-stats` to fail when not having a linear commit history. The script now skips a dataset update based on revision, but only if the `descriptive_stats.json` file does not exist. To ensure that the main readme is always up to date, we change the make command always to update it.
